	<h4>Basketball</h4>
	<p>I have been playing basketball since about 12 years old. I love the game of baksetball, it has brought me many great friendships and lessons about life.
		<br> Here is a video and a song of another favorite basketball player of mine, Damian Lillard</p>

	<h4>Video Games</h4>

	<p>Video games have always been part of my life. They provide a great escape when you are tired of working hard all day.</p>

	<h4>Clothing</h4>

	<p>I have always been into clothing and sneakers since I was very young. I started to get into it heavily when my grndfather and my dad gave some old
	sneakers from the 90s (<a href="https://www.flightclub.com/air-foamposite-one-dark-neon-royal-white-black-040046">Foamposites</a>
	and <a href="https://www.flightclub.com/air-jordan-4-retro-white-black-010026">White Cement 4s</a>).
	About a year or two later I figured out how to sell those sneakers and make money to buy more sneakers.
	I kept doing this from ages 12 to about 21. If I wasn't playing video games or doing basketball drills, I was looking for deals on sneakers that I could wear and then sell.</p>
